Create an AWS Account: If you donâ€™t have one, create an AWS account.
IAM User and Policy:
Create an IAM user for Jenkins with administrative permissions.
Generate Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for the IAM user.
Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance
Instance Selection:
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For Jenkins, an Ubuntu AMI or Amazon Linux 2 is recommended.
Select an instance type. t2.medium is a good starting point for Jenkins, but this can be adjusted based on load.
Security Group Configuration:
Configure a security group to allow inbound traffic on port 8080 for Jenkins and port 22 for SSH.
Set appropriate IP ranges for access. For example, limit SSH access to specific IPs.
Storage:
Allocate a storage volume of at least 30GB to handle Jenkins installation and build data.
Key Pair:
Create or use an existing key pair for SSH access to the instance.
Step 3: Connect to Your EC2 Instance
SSH Access:
Use the key pair to SSH into your EC2 instance from your local machine.
Step 4: Install Jenkins
Java Installation:
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) as Jenkins requires Java to run.
Jenkins Installation:
Add the Jenkins repository to the package manager.
Import the repository key.
Update your package manager and install Jenkins.
Start Jenkins:
Start the Jenkins service and ensure it is enabled to start on boot.
Step 5: Configure Jenkins
Initial Setup:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://<your-ec2-public-dns>:8080.
Retrieve the initial admin password from the Jenkins logs on the EC2 instance.
Complete the setup wizard, installing suggested plugins.
Create Admin User:
Create a new admin user and set a secure password.
Security Configuration:
Set up role-based access control to restrict access as necessary.
Consider integrating your Jenkins instance with an external user directory like LDAP or GitHub for authentication.
Step 6: Optimize and Secure Your Setup
Install Essential Plugins:
Install plugins for Git, Docker, Pipeline builds, and any other integrations you plan to use.
SSL/TLS Configuration:
For production setups, configure SSL/TLS using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache. Let's Encrypt can be used for SSL certificates.
Performance Tuning:
Adjust Java options to allocate appropriate memory to Jenkins: e.g., -Xmx2048m for 2GB of heap space.
Configure the build log rotation to save disk space.
System Monitoring:
Set up CloudWatch monitoring for the EC2 instance to track CPU, memory, and disk usage.
Install Jenkins monitoring plugins to keep track of build queue and executor status.
Step 7: Create Backup and Recovery Plan
Backup Jenkins Home:
Regularly backup the JENKINS_HOME directory where Jenkins stores its configurations and job data.
Use AWS services like S3 for storing backups.
Automate Backups:
Schedule automated backup jobs within Jenkins or using third-party tools.
Step 8: Set Up Jenkins Agents
AWS Integration:
Configure Jenkins to use AWS EC2 instances as agents.
Install the EC2 plugin and configure it to dynamically provision EC2 instances based on load.
Connect Agents:
Launch and connect Jenkins agents either manually or through automated scripts.
