Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Prepare Your GCP Environment
Create a GCP Account:

If you donâ€™t have a GCP account, create one at Google Cloud Platform.
GCP Console:

Log in to the GCP Console.
Create a Project:

In the GCP Console, create a new project or select an existing one.
Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine (VM) Instance
Navigate to VM Instances:

Go to the "Compute Engine" section and select "VM Instances".
Create a New Instance:

Click on "Create Instance".
Configure VM Instance:

Name: Give a name to your VM instance (e.g., jenkins-server).
Region and Zone: Choose a region and zone close to your location.
Machine Type: Select a suitable machine type (e.g., e2-medium).
Boot Disk:

Click on "Change" under the Boot disk section.
Select "Ubuntu" as the operating system and choose a version (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).
Firewall:

Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic by checking the respective boxes.
Create the Instance:

Click "Create" to launch the VM.
Step 3: Connect to the VM
SSH into VM:
Once the VM is running, click on the "SSH" button next to your instance in the GCP Console.
Alternatively, you can use gcloud CLI:
gcloud compute ssh <instance-name>
Step 4: Install Jenkins
Update System Packages:

Update the package list to ensure all repositories are up to date.
Install Java:

Install OpenJDK, as Jenkins requires Java to run.
Add Jenkins Repository:

Add the Jenkins repository to the list of available package sources.
Install Jenkins:

Install Jenkins using the package manager.
Start Jenkins:

Start the Jenkins service and enable it to start on boot.
Step 5: Configure Jenkins
Initial Setup:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://<your-vm-external-ip>:8080.
Retrieve the initial admin password from the Jenkins log file on the VM.
Complete the setup wizard and install the recommended plugins.
Create Admin User:

Set up a new admin user with a secure password.
Security Configuration:

Configure role-based access control or integrate with external authentication providers if needed.
Step 6: Optimize and Secure Jenkins
Install Essential Plugins:

Install necessary plugins such as Git, Docker, and Pipeline, based on your requirements.
Configure SSL/TLS:

Set up SSL/TLS for secure communication using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache.
Obtain SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt or another certificate authority.
Performance Tuning:

Adjust Java options to optimize memory allocation.
Configure logging and log rotation to manage disk usage.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Set up monitoring using Stackdriver or another monitoring solution.
Install Jenkins monitoring plugins to track system and job performance.
Step 7: Backup and Recovery
Backup Jenkins Home:

Regularly backup the JENKINS_HOME directory that contains configurations and job data.
Use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) or another backup solution.
Automate Backups:

Schedule automated backup jobs within Jenkins or using GCP services like Cloud Scheduler.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you will have a fully functional Jenkins server set up on GCP, optimized for handling competitive programming tasks and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) needs.
